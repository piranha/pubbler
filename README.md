# Pubbler

Pubbler is a [TextBundle](http://textbundle.org/) publisher. You can share a
TextBundle file from [Bear.app](https://bear.app/) (or wherever) and get it
published to your static blog.

Right now it's a chat bot for Telegram which sits there and waits for a file to
arrive so it so it can publish it.
